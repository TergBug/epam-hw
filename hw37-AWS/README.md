# **AWS infrastructure**
To look at this homework you need to login to AWS with credentials in ***aws-creds*** file.

To build AWS infrastructure create a CloudFormation stack with uploading ***cf-template.yaml*** file.

RDS and S3 are not built by the CloudFormation template.

After building AWS infrastructure you can check a documentation (***/documentation*** endpoint, or link on index page) 
with endpoint list to make some Http-requests to my REST application. You can do it with Postman, curl, and also 
it works from this Swagger documentation.

User and admin credentials for my application you can find in ***app-creds*** file.
